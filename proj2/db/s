I and other two guys are insterested in this rental in 3022 1/2 22nd Ave W, Seattle. We are all international students from China and are going to attend Northeastern University the Seattle Campus this fall. We all have good living habits and want to live together. 

As this is a 2-bedroom condo, I'm wondering is there an option for accomodating three(for example, one sleep in the living room)? It would be nice if you hava the floor plan of this unit. 

And my another question: Do we have to wait till 9/7 to move in?

Looking forward to your reply. Thank you.


Hello! I and other two guys are interested in your rental. We are all international students from China and are going to attend Northeastern University the Seattle Campus this fall and we all have good living habits. Sorry that we don't have valid USA phone number yet, since we are still in China now. The earliest of us will be arriving on 24 August. We have deposit certificates and our school will verify them if you need.

I want to know where should we apply for this rental? Is there an official website? ?

Looking forward to your reply. Thank you.
